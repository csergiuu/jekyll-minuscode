# Minuscode Jekyll Base Template based off Barry Clark's [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now)

## Quick Start

### Fork this to your User Repository

Fork this repo, then rename the repository to yourgithubusername.github.io.

Your Jekyll blog will often be viewable immediately at <http://yourgithubusername.github.io> (if it's not, you can often force it to build by completing step 2)

In case of a project page
1. git checkout -b gh-pages
2. git push origin gh-pages
3. check at http://yourgithubusername.github.io/project-name

## Local Development

1. Install Jekyll and plug-ins in one fell swoop. `gem install github-pages` This mirrors the plug-ins used by GitHub Pages on your local machine including Jekyll, Sass, etc.
2. Clone down your fork `git clone git@github.com:yourusername/yourusername.github.io.git`
3. Serve the site and watch for markup/sass changes `jekyll serve`
4. View your website at http://0.0.0.0:4000
5. Commit any changes and push everything to the master branch of your GitHub user repository. GitHub Pages will then rebuild and serve your website.
